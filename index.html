            <h2>What Are Yaad Style Patties? </h2>
            <p>Many nationalities have a form of patty. It is basically a pastry shell filled with a combination of meat, vegetables, and more. To me, there is nothing at all quite like a Jamaican beef patty. This kind of patty is the most popular convenience food in Jamaica. It’s filled with well-seasoned beef, moist, and features Jamaica’s infamous scotch bonnet pepper. You can almost spot the patty from a mile away with its rich, deep yellow outer shell. Often eaten straight from a brown paper bag and sometimes paired with Jamaica’s other ubiquitous item- coco bread.</p>

                <p> Make the dough. Whisk together the flour, salt, sugar, curry and turmeric powders. Add the grated butter into the bowl and combine with the dry ingredients. Then pour in the ice water and bring the dough together.
                    Knead the dough. Empty the dough out onto a clean surface and knead the dough. Just enough until the dough forms into one cohesive mass.
                    Chill the dough. Cover the dough and place in the fridge to chill.
                    Make the filling. Brown the ground beef. Then add in the onion and cook until tender. Stir in the garlic + ginger. Toss in the spices/herbs and continue cooking. Then add the stock, breadcrumbs, and butter.
                    Cool the filling. Set the filling aside to cool down before patty assembly.
                    Beef patty assembly. Roll out the dough then fill with some of the beef filling. Shape into a half moon and then use a fork to seal in the seams.
                    Bake the patties. Place in the oven to bake up until they’re golden brown.
                    Cool & serve. Let the patties cool some and then serve immediately!
